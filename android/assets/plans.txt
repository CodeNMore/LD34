Theme: Two Button Controls AND Growing
==============
Main Ideas:
- Growing civilization / area / base
	- Economy expansion (mine stuff for wealth)
	- City management game mixed with RTS combat
		- Combat would be only 2 buttons
		- 2 Buttons to make workers work


		

Two Button Controls:
- Protect 2 buttons from being pressed
	- If both are pressed, it blows you up
- Someone must hit two buttons to complete a level?
	- Or hold the buttons down at the same time
- The controls are in the game
	- Two buttons make you go somewhere
- Buttons on a shirt
- Use the number 2
- Snake game (grow aswell)

Growing:
- Leveling system
- Grow/shrink to fit into places
- Level is growing, trying to catch it?
- Try to stop something from growing
- Growing plants
- Farm
- Must make things grow to achieve a goal
- Trying to grow faster than others (Fight for the Light)
